{"/":{"title":"Lectern","content":"\nWelcome to the Lectern, [Arash’s](https://arashnrim.me) digital garden meant to share whatever I know with the public in a presentable manner.\n\nI was inspired by the concept of learning in public for a long time now, and I found that making a digital garden could prove to be a viable step forward in showing that. This digital garden may be specific, but I hope that over time, it can grow into something I can look back on and also refer others to.\n\nFeel free to explore more here, and share whatever you know with me as well!

There's something I find comfortable when interacting with people I know are transparent enough to show the ups and downs of their daily lives. As a student myself, I think that one way I can reflect that transparency is to showcase what I've been learning for everyone to see.\n\nThere's definitely an added pressure in that I must be careful of what I expose, and I might also be bound to public scrutiny if I get things wrong. In the long run, though, I think that it's an interesting personal experiment to see what happens. Things are still slow at the moment (as of writing in October 2022), but I wonder where this might go in the future?","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/social/peer-helping":{"title":"Peer helping","content":"\n- A variety of interpersonal helping behaviours assumed by trained individuals who undertake a helping role with others\n- On the basis that many individuals (especially students) are likely to first turn to their peers for help before approaching a trusted adult\n- [[Ethics]] and boundaries play an important role in peer helping to protect both the helper and the helpee\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/social/perception-of-self":{"title":"Perception of self","content":"\n- Perceived as the subjective awareness of one's identity of experience\n\n## What does the self consist of?\nGenerally, the perception of self consists of four things:\n- future self;\n- self needs;\n- self-identity; and\n- personal values and beliefs","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/tags/productivity/":{"title":"Productivity","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/tags/social/":{"title":"Social","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/tags/technologies/":{"title":"Technologies","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/technologies/markdown":{"title":"Markdown","content":"\n* A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using plain-text editors\n- Grown reasonably ubiquitous for its extensive use case (e.g., storing large textual content) in a way that is standard and easy to understand\n\n## Syntax\n\n| Symbol | Description |\n|:-------|:------------|\n| ** **  | Bold        |\n| * *    | Italicise   |\n| ~ ~    | Strikethrough |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/technologies/obsidian":{"title":"Obsidian","content":"\n- A [[technologies/markdown]]-based note-taking app centred around keeping distinct ideas connected through identifying relationships they share with one another\n- Marketed as \"a second brain, for you, forever\"\n- Features a vault-like system for organisation with pure Markdown files, assuring that [[data]] won't be lost if Obsidian eventually shuts down (since it's a [[closed source]] service)\n- A form of [[productivity/personal-knowledge-management]]\n\n## How should I use Obsidian?\n* As much as possible, each note within Obsidian should be atomic in its own right, meaning that each page is for a specific item to talk about\n* **Don't try to force yourself to think of more things for a nice graph view.** The more you do it, the more you'll eventually tire yourself out\n\n## Personal opinion\n- Pretty cool that backlinking is easy, and that relationships between notes are prioritised (described as \"links being first-class citizens\" by Obsidian)","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null},"/technologies/web3":{"title":"Web3","content":"\n- An idea of what a new web could be like, focused on the [[blockchain]], [[decentralisation]], and [[cryptocurrency]].\n- Not to be confused with Web 3.0, which is the next iteration of the [[World Wide Web]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-12T16:40:20.333723465Z","tags":null}}
