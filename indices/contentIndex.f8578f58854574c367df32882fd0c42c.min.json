A common distribution is the normal distribution.\n\nGenerally, the probability of a continuous set of data can be found through the area under the graph. This applies to density functions that are rectangular, linear, or triangular in nature and more. Therefore, if a probability is asked for a specific singular value (e.g., $P(X = a)$), the answer will always be 0.\n\n# Normal distribution\n\nAlso known as the normal curve or Gaussian distribution. Its curve follows the shape of a bell-shaped curve and it describes many sets of data that occur. The curve is symmetrical about a vertical axis through the mean $\\mu$.\n\n$\\mu$ offsets the location of the bell-shaped curve horizontally; $\\sigma$ offsets the height (proportional) and spread (inversely proportional) of the bell-shaped curve.\n\nA normal distribution is only valid if three conditions are met:\n- $f(X) \u003e 0$ for all values of $x$. In other words, the graph must be above the x-axis.\n- The total area under the curve must be equal to 1.\n- The normal curve must be symmetric about the vertical axis at $x = \\mu$.

This standard form is known as standard normal distribution. A standard normal distribution has the following notation:\n$$\nZ \\sim N(0, 1)\n$$\nStandard normal distribution standardises the different normal curves into one with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nOnce standardised, any normal distribution can be used together with the standard normal Z-table to compute the area under all different curves.\n\nIn order to standardise a random variable $X$ into its standardised value $Z$, the following formula needs to be done:\n$$\nZ = \\frac {X - \\mu} \\sigma\n$$\nIn order to read the standard normal Z-table, the value of $z$ must be a positive value.\n\nUsing the standard normal Z-table, we can find $\\phi (z)$.

Utilised by operating systems to store and access information on a computer. The file system manages, stores, and retrieves information and allocates locations on the storage and keeps a record of where specific information is kept.\n\nSome examples of commonly-used file systems:\n- [[technologies/computers/file-allocation-table|File Allocation Table]] (FAT), used in legacy Windows computers;\n\t- FAT32, a version of FAT designed by Microsoft;\n- Extensible File Allocation Table (exFAT), used in modern windows computers;\n- New Technology File System (NTFS), used in modern Windows computers;\n- Hierarchical File System (HFS), used in legacy Apple computers; and\n- Apple File System (APFS), used in modern Apple computers.\n\nA file system consists of folders and files. Folders can be organised in a hierarchy that is similar to a tree structure. Operating system files should be and usually are kept separate to ensure that important files are not deleted by users.\n\n\n# Pathnames\n\nPathnames are used to locate and identify specific files within a file system. There are two kinds of pathnames:\n- absolute pathnames; and\n- relative pathnames.\n\nFor the following two examples, consider the following structure:\n\n```\n                  root\n                    │\n        ┌───────────┼────────────┐\n        ╵           ╵            ╵\n    personal      group       family\n\n   readme.txt   report.docx   Jan10.png\n      tasks      fsp.java     May10.jpg\n```\n\n## Absolute pathnames\nUsed to identify the path to a file from the root directory (`/` in Linux-like terminals and `\\` in Windows, usually `C:`).\n\nTo target `May10.jpg` from `personal`, using absolute pathnames, the path will be:\n```\nroot/family/May10.jpg\n```\n\n## Relative pathnames\nUsed to identify the path to a file from the current directory.\n\nTo target `May10.jpg` from `personal`, using relative pathnames, the path will be:\n```\n../family/May10.jpg\n```\n(To navigate to `May10.jpg`, you need to go up one directory (`../`) then into the `family` directory to access the file.)\n\n# Files\n\nA set of data grouped in some logical manner, assigned a name, and stored on the disk. The file system records where the file is located on the disk for retrieval later. Data in files must be converted into a digital format (binary) that the computer can understand.\n\nBesides the content of the file, some metadata is also stored alongside in the file:\n- the date and time of:\n\t- the file's creation;\n\t- the file's last modification; and\n\t- the file's last access;\n- the file's size;\n- the file's attributes (e.g., security information, last back up time);\n- the file's compression status; and\n- the file's encryption status.\n\n# Storage types\n\nThere are generally two types of storage used in modern day computers:\n- hard disk drives (HDD); and\n- solid-state drives (SSD).\n\nHard disk drives are spinning hard drives that are commonly used in legacy computers. They are magnetic in nature, meaning that they are more prone to drops and shocks than solid-state drives. Hard disk drives are low-level formatted when delivered from the manufacturer.\n\nSolid state drives are similar to hard disk drives, but are more efficient and performant than hard disk drives. They are generally much more expensive, though.\n\n# Fragmentation and defragmentation\n\n## Fragmentation\n\nThe wastage of disk space within the cluster due to the actual file size being smaller than the allocated space. Also known as slack space (or file slack), which is the space between the end of a file and the end of the cluster it is stored in.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221121094315.png]]\n\nOccurs when a file is divided into pieces scattered around the disk, and of which is usually caused by frequently creating, deleting, and modifying files. Usually caused by the deletion of small files which leaves small sets of contiguous clusters insufficient enough to be filled by a bigger new file.\n\nFragmentation results in the OS searching the disk for diferent groups of clusters scattered around the disk, degarding system performance of disk operations.\n\nit is important to note that fragmentation only affects hard disk drives; most if not all solid-state drives do not face the issue of fragmentation.\n\n## Defragmentation\nThe process of consolidating fragmented files on a computer's hard disk by physically reorganising the contents of the disk. In Windows, the [Disk Defragmenter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/defragment-your-windows-10-pc-048aefac-7f1f-4632-d48a-9700c4ec702a) is a system utility tool that handles the defragmentation of a hard disk drive.\n\n# Partitioning\n\nThe process of splitting a single physical storage into a number of partitions or volumes. In Windows, partitions or volumes may be assigned a drive letter. Each partition must be formatted using a particular file system. In Windows, [Disk Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/overview-of-disk-management) is a system utility tool that allows users to preview and partition their storage.\n\n# Formatting\n\nThe process of preparing a chosen partition of the storage to be used by an OS by deleting all the data and setting up a file system.\n\nIn the first sector of the formatted partiiton, a boot block is created. The boot block contains the root folder, which contains:\n- file information, including the file's\n\t- name;\n\t- start cluster;\n\t- size;\n\t- creation time; and\n\t- modification time; and\n- file attributes (e.g., hidden, read-only, and archive).\n\n# Authorisation\n\nThe file manager tracks each user's authorisation to access file using file attributes, or codes signifying the ability of every system user to manipulate the file.\n\nAttributes used by Linux (and Linux-like OS terminals including macOS) and Unix include:\n- `d` (directory; a file is indicated with `-`);\n- `r` (read);\n- `w` (write); and\n- `x` (execute).\n\nThe code has the following format; to explain, the following example is used:\n```\ndrwxr-xr-x\n╷─┬╴─┬╴─┬╴\n│ │  │  └╴permissions for world (everyone)\n│ │  └╴permissions for group\n│ └╴permissions for owner\n└╴directory or file indicator (d or -)\n```\nAttributes used by Windows include:\n- `D` (directory);\n- `R` (read-only);\n- `S` (executable);\n- `H` (hidden); and\n- `A` (archived).\n\n# Components\n\n## Boot sector\n\nA section on the storage that includes information on how to start the boot process to load an operating system. There are two types of boot sectors:\n- master boot record (MBR); and\n- volume boot record (VBR).\n\n### Master boot record\n\nThe master boot record is the first sector of a partitioned storage and holds the information (including the file system) on the logical partitions on the storage. There can only be one master boot record in a storage.\n\n### Volume boot record\n\nThe first sector of a partition, used to contain:\n- code initiating the boot process or loading an OS; \n- the file system type; and\n- parameter information, including:\n\t- bytes per sector; and\n\t- sector per cluster.\n\n## Directory entry\n\nA 32-byte reference to every file and folder. Contains metadata and information including the:\n- name of the file/folder;\n- time and date (MAC (modification, access, creation));\n- location (starting cluster);\n- size; and\n- author.","lastmodified":"2022-11-24T03:09:32.260830601Z","tags":null},"/technologies/computers/memory-management":{"title":"Memory management","content":"\nRefers to the allocation of resources to each program by the [[technologies/computers/operating-system|operating system]]. Heavily involves the [[technologies/computers/random-access-memory|random access memory]] as a resource used by programs as a working space.\n\nA memory manager has several tasks in particular:\n- allocating portions of the main memory to various programs at their request;\n- freeing portions of the main memory when no longer needed;\n- keeping track of the status of each location of the main memory; and\n- protecting the memory allocated to a program from unauthorised access by other programs.\n\nThe [[technologies/computers/operating-system-kernel|kernel]] is the part of the operating system always in the RAM as long as the computer is turned on.\n\n# Memory address\n\nA location, often in the form of a binary number, located on the memory. It can be referenced to access the content stored in-memory at that particular location. Starts from 0 to a maximum number defined by the amount of RAM in the computer.\n\nTo calculate the range of an address space provided the amount of RAM, given that $b$ is the number of bytes, find the number of bits $n$ by using $\\frac {log(b)} {log(2)}$ and use that to find the maximum value ($n$ `F`s).\n\nThe number of bits an address has is dependent on the [[technologies/computers/computer-architecture#von Neumann computer architecture|address bus]]'s width.\n\n# Memory content\n\nA particular address can store **eight bits** (one byte) of information; this information could be either a part of an instruction or data.\n\n# Frames, pages, and page tables\n\nFrames refer to compartments brought about due to the *physical* memory's storage. Pages, on the other hand, are *virtual* and refer to references created by the CPU.\n- The typical size of a frame is **4096 bytes** (4 KiB).\n- The size of a frame **must match** the size of the page.\n- Expressed differently, data or instructions are stored in the memory as frames. When the CPU references and reads or writes the memory, the CPU handles them as pages.\n\n## Page tables\n\nTo bridge the link between frames and pages, memory managers often create a page table for each process. Page tables are data structures used by the memory manager to keep track of which page corresponds to which frame.\n\nPage tables include a valid or invalid control bit which is used to tell whether or not a page is in the physical memory. In the case of demand paging, where data can be stored on the secondary storage temporarily, the control bit will be 0 (demarking it as not in the physical memory).\n\n# Logical and physical memory\n\nThe logical memory is the memory as seen as pages (i.e., seen by the CPU). The logical memory stores pages by the CPU and can be purged at any time.\n\nThe physical memory is the memory stored as-is physically, and is seen as frames.\n\n# Virtual memory and demand paging\n\nMultiple programs may be loaded into the physical memory at once (in [[technologies/computers/operating-system#Multi-tasking and multi-user OSs|multi-tasking operating systems]]). The total memory size required by the OS and all the programs may exceed the physical memory size; in this event, the OS uses virtual memory to compensate. This space is known as a swap space; on Linux, this space is a partition called `swap` while on Windows, this space is in a file named `pagefile.sys`.\n- This method makes use of the available space on the secondary storage to store programs.\n- The OS moves inactive data from the physical memory to the temporary space in the secondary storage.\n- The memory manager than swaps data to and fro the storage and memory when required.\n\nTrashing refers to the excessive swapping of pages and data between the memory and secondary storage; this causes the program to operate more slowly.","lastmodified":"2022-11-24T03:09:32.260830601Z","tags":null},"/technologies/computers/operating-system":{"title":"Operating system","content":"\nA collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for application software.

They are unique to each record and there are different kinds of keys:\n\n- Candidate key — an attribute that uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation\n- Primary key — a chosen candidate key used to uniquely identify each tuple. A primary key requires two requirements and two recommendations:\n\t- the value of the primary key should be consistent (unchanged) over time;\n\t- the value of the primary key must be non-null;\n\t- intelligent keys (keys with structures indicating the likes of classifications or locations) should be avoided; and\n\t- surrogate keys should be considered as a possible substitution.\n- Alternate key — a candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key of the record\n- Foreign key — an attribute used to create a relationship with another relation (table) within the database\n- Composite key — a key that consists of more than one attribute\n\t- In some instances, one primary key is not enough (e.g., the ISBN of a book is insufficient as a library may hold multiple copies of the same book)\n- Surrogate key — a new attribute specifically introduced into an entity to serve as the primary key\n\t- Often used when a natural identifier cannot be used to guarantee the uniqueness of each tuple\n\t- When the primary key is a composite key with many attributes, it is suggested to use a surrogate key in its place\n- Partial key — an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identify weak entities related to the same owner entity\n\n# Models\n\nConceptual database models are used to give a brief overview of what entities a database has and the relationships the entities have with each other.

Common degrees include the:\n- unary (one) degree;\n- binary (two) degree; and\n- ternary (three) degree.\n\n### Unary relationships\nRepresents the relationship between instances of a single entity. Also known as a recursive relationship.\n\n- It is important to assign a role name that signifies the function a participating entity plays in each relationship; this allows you to distinguish the meaning of each participation\n\n### Binary relationships\nRepresents the relationship between instances of two entities. Is the most common type of relationship encountered in data modelling.\n\n### Ternary relationships\nRepresents the relationship among instances of three entities.\n\n## Relationship constraints\nRelationships can be constrained such that only certain cases are valid in a database. This helps to plan out a database in greater detail.\n\n### Cardinality ratio\nRefers to the number of instances of an entity that can be associated with an instance of another entity. The three most commonly-used cardinality ratios used in databases include:\n- one-to-one (1:1) relationship;\n\t- example: one staff member supervising one branch\n- one-to-many (1:M) relationship; and\n\t- example: one book publisher publishing many books\n- many-to-many (M:N) relationship.\n\t- the 'N' is used to differentiate the letters, but still means many. Can be ignored (don't need to change)\n\t- example: many students taking many subjects\n\n### Participation\nSpecifies whether the existence of an entity depends upon it being another entity through the relationship. Shown in the ER diagram as different strokes of lines connecting entities and relationships.\n\nGenerally has two participation constraints:\n- partial/optional participation, where instances of an entity are related to instances of another entity through the relationship, but not necessarily all; and\n- total/mandatory participation, where instances of an entity must be associated with an instance of the related entity.\n\n# Types\n\nThere are two types of entities that can be drawn in an ER model. These are akin to base and derived classes in object-oriented programming:\n- Supertype — generic entity that can be divided into subtypes;\n- Subtype — a subset of a supertype that shares common attributes (inheritance) or relationships distinct from other subsets.\n\t- The subtype should not have a primary key, but rather inherit a primary key from its supertype.\n\nThe process of defiing a set of subtypes of an entity is known as specialisation. \n\nThe reverse process of abstraction, which involves:\n- supressing differences among entities;\n- identifying common features; and\n- generalising the entities into a supertype;\n\nis known as generalisation.\n\n## Constraints\nSimilar to relationship constraints, there are constraints when it comes to specialisation and abstraction.\n\n### Disjointment\nAn entity must only have one subtype or can have many subtypes according to the context of the situation. This is referred to as the disjoint constraint, in which an additional symbol (a circle with a character below) is added to denote the case.\n\nWhen a specialisation consists of only one subtype, there is no need to show the disjoint constraint.\n\n- `d` is used to represent that an entity is disjoint, meaning that the entity can only be one subtype; and\n- `o` is used to represent that an entity overlaps, meaning that the entity can be more than one substype.\n\n### Participation\nSpecifies whether the existence of an entity depends upon it being another entity through the relationship. Shown in the ER diagram as different strokes of lines connecting entities and relationships.\n\nGenerally has two participation constraints:\n- partial/optional participation, where instances of an entity are related to a subtype, but not necessarily; and\n- total/mandatory participation, where instances of an entity must be associated with a subtype.\n\n# Rough outline of steps\n\n1. Identify the main entities in the user's view of the enterprise.\n2. Identify the important relationships existing between the identified entities.\n3. Associate attributes with an appropriate entity or relationship.\n4. Identify the candidate keys for each entity before settling on a primary key.\n5. Identify supertypes and subtypes where appropriate.\n6. Draw the ER model for the database.\n7. Review the ER model.\n8.
