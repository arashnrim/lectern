A file system developed by Microsoft optimised for flash memory (e.g., USB flash drives and SD cards). Often used when [[technology/computers/new-technology-file-system|NTFS]] is unavailable but the size limit of [[technology/computers/file-allocation-table|FAT]] is too small. By far the most cross-platform-compatible file system, with support in Linux, Windows, and macOS.
