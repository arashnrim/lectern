A network device that provides a connection between wireless devices up to 100 metres away. Usually connects to wired networks and supplies a wireless network. Most wireless access points create wireless networks conforming to the Wi-Fi standard.

Usually are fitten with several components, including:
- antennae;
- radio frequency transmitters;
- radio frequency receivers;
- RJ45 wired network interface (typically using [[technology/networking/ethernet|Ethernet]]); and a 
- power supply.
	- Most modern APs support Power over Ethernet, a standard or ad hoc system that passes electric power along with data in the Ethernet cabling

# Multiple-input and multiple-output

A method for multiplying the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmission and receiving antennae, exploiting multipath propogation. APs and end-user devices should both support MIMO for optimal performance and range.

Specifications for MIMO APs are given in the following format:

where:
- O refers to the number of output antennae;
- I refers to the number of input antennae; and
- S refers to the number of concurrent separate data streams.
