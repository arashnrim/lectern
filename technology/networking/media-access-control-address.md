A 6-byte (i.e., 48-bit) identifier for a network device typically fixed and tied to the device's hardware. Typically comprises of two components to it, namely the:
- organisational unique number—a number assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority Committee to manufacturers; and
- [[technology/networking/network-interface-controller|network interface controller]] number—a number typically assigned by the manufacturer.

Usually expressed in a hexadecimal format of a byte per section, separated by colons. MAC addresses therefore range from 00:00:00:00:00:00 to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.
