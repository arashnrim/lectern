# Why do I want to learn in public?

I think that learning in public has been something eye-catching for me for one particular reason: transparency. There's something I find comfortable when interacting with people I know are transparent enough to show the ups and downs of their daily lives. As a student myself, I think that one way I can reflect that transparency is to showcase what I've been learning for everyone to see.

There's definitely an added pressure in that I must be careful of what I expose, and I might also be bound to public scrutiny if I get things wrong. In the long run, though, I think that it's an interesting personal experiment to see what happens. Things are still slow at the moment (as of writing in October 2022), but I wonder where this might go in the future?
