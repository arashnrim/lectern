Welcome to the Lectern, [Arash’s](https://arashnrim.me) digital garden meant to share whatever I know with the public in a presentable manner.

I was inspired by the concept of learning in public for a long time now, and I found that making a digital garden could prove to be a viable step forward in showing that. This digital garden may be specific, but I hope that over time, it can grow into something I can look back on and also refer others to.

Feel free to explore more here, and share whatever you know with me as well! If there’s anything that’s factually incorrect that you’re willing to correct, please feel free to contact me.
