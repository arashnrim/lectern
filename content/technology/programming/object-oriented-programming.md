Object-oriented programming has four main concepts:
	- [[technology/programming/encapsulation|encapsulation]];
	- [[technology/programming/inheritance|inheritance]];
	- [[technologies/programming/classes|abstract classes and instances]]; and
	- [[technologies/programming/polymorphism|polymorphism]]
