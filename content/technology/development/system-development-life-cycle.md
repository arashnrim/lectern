A set of activities, methodologies, best practices, deliverables, and automated tools stakeholders use to develop and maintain information systems and software. Often related to in different [[software-development-methodology|methodologies]].

Important and frequently used as it ensures:
- consistent process;
- efficiencies allowing the sharing of resources between projects;
- the production of consistent documentation that reduces lifetime costs to maintain the systems; and
- the promotion of quality and control.

# Cycle

There are six components to the SDLC:

1. Analysis — At this stage, the team defines and identifies what the system should do and objectives are understood. Requirements are gathered where required with the client with the team.
2. Design — At this stage, the team determines how best to create the system, defining what the system looks like and how the parts fit together.
3. Construction — At this stage, the team builds the system according to the design created.
4. Testing — At this stage, the team tests if the constructed system works according to the design and fulfils the user requirements.
5. Installation — At this stage, the system is installed and delivered for use by the team to the client.
6. Maintenance — At this stage, the team maintains the changes done after delivery and fixes any issues that arise.
