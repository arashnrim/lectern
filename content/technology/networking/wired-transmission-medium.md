Wired networks remain ubiquitous even in today's world, owing to their performance in transmitting data compared to wireless transmission media. 

The two common types of wired transmission medium include:

- twisted pair cables; and
- optical fibre cables.

# Twisted pair cables

There are two types of twisted pair cables:
- shielded twisted pair (STP) cables, in which an additional layer of foil or wire braid is woven around the twisted pairs; and
- unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, in which there is a lack of foil or wire braid but costs are lower.

The most commonly-used type of cable, RJ45, uses unshielded twisted pair cables. Ethernet is a protocol that is built on RJ45 cables.

# Optical fibre cables

Often used in [[technology/networking/area-networks#Local area network|LANs]] and especially used in cases where electromagnetic interference is an issue. A more modern format compared to twisted pair cables, offering better bandwidth, transmission distance, and resistance as well as lower maintenance.

There are two types of optical fibre cables:
- single-mode optical fibre, in which a laser light source is used for transmission; and
- multimode optical fibre, in which an LED light source is used for transmission.

There are different kinds of connectors that optical fibre cables can use. Some popular ones include the:
- ST connector, often used for multimode fibre;
- SC connector, often used for single-mode fibre; and
- LC conected, often highly favoured for single-mode fibre.

Optical fibre cables are fragile as they contain glass. Should the cables bend, the network can fail entirely.

# Comparison

There are a few things to note when considering which type of wired transmission medium to use. You may consider the:

- possibility of interference, where:
	- optical fibre cables are immune to electromagnetic induction;
	- STP cables are protected, but not immune, from interference by shielding with a metallic screen; and
	- UTP are susceptible to interference;
- difficulty of installation, where:
	- optical fibre cables are difficult to install as they are fragile and require mechanical protection (e.g., plastic sleeves, steel armour); and
	- STP cables are thick and less flexible than UTP cables;
- safety, where:
	- electric current flowing through copper cables (i.e., twisted pair cables) can pose shock and fire hazards and cause sparks;
- maintenance, where:
	- optical fibre cables can last for a long time; while
	- copper cables deteriorate over time.
