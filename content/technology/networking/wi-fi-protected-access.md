A brand of security algorithms developed after 2000 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure Wi-Fi networks. Also referred to by the TKIP standard. Defined in response to critical weaknesses in [[technology/networking/wired-equivalent-privacy|WEP]].

# WPA2

The successor to WPA, introduced in 2004. Requires testing and certification by the Alliance and implements mandatory elements stated by the IEEE standard (802.11i), including mandatory support for Counter Mode Cipher Blocking Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP), an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-based encryption mode.

There are two types of the WPA2 security type, namely:
- WPA2-Personal (also known as WPA2-PSK), where the security keys provided on end-user devices must match the key set on the wireless [[technology/networking/network-router|router]] or [[technology/networking/wireless-access-point|wireless AP]]; and
- WPA2-Enterprise, where a remote authentication server (e.g., a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server) is employed.
