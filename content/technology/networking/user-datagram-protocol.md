A connectionless protocol under the [[technology/networking/transport-layer|transport layer of the internet protocol suite]]. Starts data transfers without establishing a connection and is therefore less reliable but simple with low overhead.

Often used for transaction-based services such as:
- [[technology/networking/domain-name-system|DNS systems]]; and
- the [[technology/networking/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol|DHCP]].
