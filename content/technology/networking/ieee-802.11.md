A part of the IEEE 802 standards (relating to [[technology/networking/area-networks#Local area network|LANs]]) that specifies the set of media access control and physical layer protocols for implementing [[technology/networking/wireless-transmission-medium#Wireless LAN|WLANs]]. Most commonly known to be the standard employed by the Wi-Fi Alliance known as Wi-Fi.

# IEEE 802.11aâ€“802.11be

The Wi-Fi Alliance came up with a consumer-friendly generation numbering scheme in 2018. It denotes a numerical numbering system for different substandards employing the IEEE 802.11 protocol. The table below shows the details of each generation:

| Wi-Fi generation | IEEE standard | Frequency band | Maximum transmission rate | Year introduced |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Wi-Fi 1 | 802.11b | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | 1999 |
| Wi-Fi 2 | 802.11a | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps | 1999 |
| Wi-Fi 3 | 802.11g | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | 2003 |
| Wi-Fi 4 | 802.11n | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz | 150 Mbps per stream, 4 antennae | 2009 |
| Wi-Fi 5 | 802.11ac | 5 GHz | 867 Mbps per stream, 8 antennae | 2014 |
| Wi-Fi 6 | 802.11ax | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 9608 Mbps | 2019, 2021 (6 GHz) |
| Wi-Fi 7 | 802.11be | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 46120 Mbps | 2024 |

# IEEE 802.11s

The IEEE 802.11s standard enables wireless devices to conect to each other, creating a mesh network. The Wi-Fi Alliance created Wi-Fi EasyMesh that exists under this standard, bringing interoperability to mesh Wi-Fi hardware.
