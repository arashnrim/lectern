A framework for organising the set of communication protocols used in the internet and similar networks. Also commonly known as the [[technology/networking/transmission-control-protocol|TCP]]/[[technology/networking/internet-protocol|IP]] protocol suite.

The suite is somewhat similar to, but is not necessarily the same, as the [[technology/networking/open-systems-interconnection-model|OSI model]]. Has four layers in total, namely the:
1. network interface layer, including data link and physical interfaces (e.g., Ethernet and wireless LAN);
2. [[technology/networking/internet-layer|internet layer]], including interfaces that connect to the internet (e.g., the IP);
3. [[technology/networking/transport-layer|transport layer]], including interfaces responsible for transport (e.g., TCP and UDP); and
4. application layer, includding applications that use the internet (e.g., HTTP, DHCP, DNS, FTP).
