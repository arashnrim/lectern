A network device that constructs a single network and provides connection points to all network-enabled devices to form a local area network. The terminologies are different, but both refer to the same thing:

- When connecting two similar networks together, the device is known as a network bridge.
- When connecting more than two similar networks together, the device is known as a network switch.
