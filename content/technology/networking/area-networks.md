When talking about networking, there are three kinds of area networks that are of importance. They include the:

- local area network;
- metropolitan area network; and
- wide area network.

# Local area network

The most common kind of network which spans a small geographical area (e.g., within a building, in a house, or multiple buildings within a campus).

# Metropolitan area network

A network that spans a medium-sized geographical area such as a town or city, often spanning across two or more buildings within the same town or city. Not as common as LANs or WANs.

# Wide area network

A network that spans across wide geographical locations, often over geographical boundaries (e.g., countries).
