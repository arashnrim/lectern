Devices connected to a computer are managed by connections to the processor. There are two parts to device management, particularly the hardware aspect ([device controller](#device-controller)) and software aspect ([device driver](#device-driver)).

# Device controller

A system that handles the incoming and outgoing signals of the CPU. Connected to the computer via a plug and socket, of which the socket is connected to the controller. Controllers come in embedded and external forms.

Some devices may have device controllers built within them. Common devices with such include external storages and speakers.

# Device driver

A program that controls a particular type of device attached to a computer. Translates computer code to instructions the device can comprehend.
