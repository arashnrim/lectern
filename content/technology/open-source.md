A term used to initially refer to software or hardware with source code that is publically accesible. Currently has expanded its scope of definition, ranging from software to a movement and way of working. Current definitions to open source by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd) include additional restraints, including:

- free redistribution, where open-source products must not require a royalty or other fee;
- having open source code, where distribution must be allowed in source code and the compiled form,
- allowing derived works, where open-source products must be allowed modifications and derived works by other authors, and more.

# Licencing

Licencing plays a big role in open source; developers who write products must assign a relevant licence to be considered an open-source product. Licences restrict what authors who make deriviations from an original open-source product can or cannot do, including governing the use of copyright, distribution ability, and rights.

Common open source licences can be found on [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/), a guide-like website made by GitHub to help developers pick an appropriate licence for their projects.
