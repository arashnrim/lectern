## Discerning what's important
(Notes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms))
- Understand the difference between **conceptual notes** and **sequential notes**
    - Conceptual notes: atomic and specific notes that extend what you know
    - Sequential notes: taken in order of presentation (e.g., in class, as a lecturer is teaching)
- Try to prioritise conceptual notes over sequential notes, since the latter combines your knowledge (both old and new) into one without decaying the older ones
    - Old notes provide a framework or foundation for making learning new content easier
- Questions can come up in real-time instead of after class when analysing sequential notes
- It's too much work to go back and rewrite whatever content the lecturer has gone through; that's likely why we focus on writing sequentially

[[technology/obsidian|Obsidian]]-specific tips
- Try not to make a note for the concepts you already know; it's already in your primary database (your mind!)
- Don't treat this as a big project management project; it is not
- You're not here to hoard data, you're here to organise your thoughts
- Try to impose as little structure to your notes
