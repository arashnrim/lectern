The process of consolidating and collecting information that can be used to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve, and share knowledge in daily activities

## Methods of PKM
- Data hoarding — collecting as much information as possible and storing it in a way that can be used in the future; inefficient, as it is time-consuming to come up with data that is unnecessary
- Zettelkasten method — accumulating 'knowledge clusters' and curating topics according to curiosity

## Common PKM software of today
- Notion — block-based software that is heavily customisable and flexible; used by many people for different reasons
- Obsidian — Markdown-based software that aims to identify and strengthen links between ideas
