- Organised collection of data
- Generally more advantageous compared to spreadsheets, given that they have:
	- a fast and easy setup;
	- more storage;
	- has built-in tools to see all data at a glance;
	- support for encryption; and
	- the ability to faciltiate multiple connections at once

# Tables

- Hold particular data about a particular subject
- Organised into rows (records) and columns (fields)

### Conventions
#### Table names
- Lowercase and not include spaces (underscores instead)
- Should refer to a collective group or be plural

#### Field names
- Lowercase and not include spaces (underscores instead)
- Should be singular, unique, and different from the table name

# Fields
- Often [[technologies/data-typing|data typed]] and store a particular piece of required information
