- The process of assigning a type to a particular variable or value
- Often done to:
	- dynamically allocate a certain amount of memory (for instance, `double` allocates twice as many bits as `float`); and
	- restrict operations (as some operations, like division, can only be done for certain types)

- Different languages can have different data types, but the common few include:

| Data type | Used for |
|:-:|:-|
| integer | Whole numbers |
| float | Numbers with a floating point decimal |
| character | Any kind of character |
| string | A chain of characters |
| Boolean | True or false values |
| list/array | A collection of data types |
