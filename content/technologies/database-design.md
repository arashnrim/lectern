The process of coming up with entities and models to be used in a future database. Considered a critical process in the planning and development of a database for use.

# Terminologies

> For a Salesperson entity, the employee number, name, date of birth, gender, and email address are examples of relevant attributes to the person.

# Models

Conceptual database models are used to give a brief overview of what entities a database has and the relationships the entities have with each other. Like flowcharts, shapes resemble different things in the model.
