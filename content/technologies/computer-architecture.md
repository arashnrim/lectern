Describes how a [[technologies/computer|computer]] is designed and built to function, including how parts of the computer are designed, organised, and connected.

# von Neumann computer architecture

There may be many kinds of computer architecture, but a popular one (that is used in current studies) is the von Neumann computer architecture. The architecture describes a computer with the following components:

- a [[technologies/central-processing-unit|central processing unit]] with both an arithmetic logic unit and registers;
	- control units that include an instruction register and program counter;
- memory to store data and instructions;
- external [[technologies/secondary-storage|secondary storage]]; and
- input and output mechanisms.

Generally, the architecture also defines the use of buses (collections of wires used as a medium to transport data from one part of a computer to another). There are three buses that are used in this architecture:

- Data bus: A bidirectional (two-way) bus that is mainly used to transport data between the memory, I/O devices, and processor
- Address bus: A unidirectional (one-way) bus that is mainly used to transport address information usually from the processor to memory
- Control bus: A bidirectional (two-way) bus that is mainly used to transport control signals and clock pulses
