- A [[technologies/markdown]]-based note-taking app centred around keeping distinct ideas connected through identifying relationships they share with one another
- Marketed as "a second brain, for you, forever"
- Features a vault-like system for organisation with pure Markdown files, assuring that [[data]] won't be lost if Obsidian eventually shuts down (since it's a [[closed source]] service)
- A form of [[productivity/personal-knowledge-management]]

## How should I use Obsidian?
* As much as possible, each note within Obsidian should be atomic in its own right, meaning that each page is for a specific item to talk about
* **Don't try to force yourself to think of more things for a nice graph view.** The more you do it, the more you'll eventually tire yourself out

## Personal opinion
- Pretty cool that backlinking is easy, and that relationships between notes are prioritised (described as "links being first-class citizens" by Obsidian)
