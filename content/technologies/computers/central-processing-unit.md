A component that processes data according to a set of instructions. Often abbreviated as CPU. Clock speeds are measured in gigahertz (GHz); the faster the clock speed, the faster the performance. Has three distinguishable units within the CPU:

- [arithmetic logic unit](#arithmetic-logic-unit) — processes data by performing basic mathematical and logical operations;
- [control unit](#control-unit) — follows instructions and decides when data should be stored, received, or transmitted by different parts of the computer; and
- registers — small and temporary storage used by the processor to temporarily store data.

Modern CPUs are often faster because of having more packed within them. A core has two logical processors within them; modern CPUs tend to have eight cores (therefore 16 logical processors).
