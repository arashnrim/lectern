# lectern

Welcome to the project repository for Lectern (accessible at https://lectern.arashnrim.me)! Lectern serves as my first step forward towards [learning in public](https://lectern.arashnrim.me/social/learning-in-public), and I've been interested in coming up with a digital garden for a while.

This repository hosts the source code that powers Lectern. It is mainly derived (and generated from) the amazing [Quartz by Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). If you're here from that repository, welcome aboard! :)

## Motivations

Learning in public has been a concept I find interesting because of its transparency, and I wanted to find a way in which I can do that without much friction (i.e., in a way that is seamless, intuitive, and uncomplex). I stumbled across Quartz a while back, and I've been interested since coming across it to make my own version!
